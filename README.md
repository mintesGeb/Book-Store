General Comment 

We believe , we have incorporated all the requirements for this project and even pushed a bit more. But, Of course, it is far from being complete and there is still a huge room for improvement, especially, on the front end. User interface needs a lot of brushing up. Displaying error messages in a user friendly manner is where we felt like we lacked somehow. We will continue to develop it , now that we have all the framework and structure ready. And detail report follows: 

//Front End
